# XAPK Viewer

XAPK Viewer is a simple program that allows you to view the contents of an XAPK file without extracting anything.
In addition to being able to view the content, you can also extract the APK and OBB files contained in it and also the application icon.

But it does not allow editing of the file

Useful if you want to extract APK and OBB from the XAPK file and proceed with the manual installation.
